  neurodata_type_inc: Events
  doc: A list of timestamps, stored in seconds, of an event that can have different labels. For example,
    this type could represent the times that reward was given, as well as which of three different 
    types of reward was given. In this case, the 'label_keys' dataset would contain values {0, 1, 2},
    and the 'labels' dataset would contain three text elements, where the first (index 0) specifies the
    name of the reward associated with a label_keys = 0, the second (index 1) specifies the name of the
    reward associated with a label_keys = 1, etc. The labels do not have to start at 0 and do not need to
    be sequential, e.g. the 'label_keys' dataset could contain values {0, 10, 100}, and the 'labels' 
    dataset could contain 101 values, where labels[0] is 'No reward', labels[10] is '10% reward', 
    labels[100] is 'Full reward', and all other entries in 'labels' are the empty string.

    doc: Integer labels that map onto strings using the mapping in the 'labels' dataset. Values must
      be 0 or greater and need not be sequential. This dataset should have the same number of elements 
      as the 'timestamps' dataset.

    doc: Mapping from an integer (the zero-based index) to a string, used to understand the integer
      values in the 'label_keys' dataset. Use an empty string to represent a label value that is not
      mapped to any text.
