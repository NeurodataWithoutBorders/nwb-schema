  doc: A list of timestamps, stored in seconds, of an event that can have different labels. For example,
    this type could represent the times that reward was given, as well as which of three different 
    types of reward was given. In this case, the 'labels' dataset would contain values from {0, 1, 2},
    and the 'label_map' would contain three text elements, where the first (index 0) specifies the
    name of the reward associated with a label = 0, the second (index 1) specifies the name of the
    reward associated with a label = 1, etc.
