Documentation for Version 2 of the NWB:N specification and later have been created by
Oliver Ruebel and Andrew Tritt et al. in collaboration with the NWB:N community.

NWB:N: Version 1.0.x and earlier
--------------------------------

The specification language and corresponding documentation for Version 1.0.5g (and earlier)
of the NWB file format were created by Jeff Teeters et al. as
part of the first NWB pilot project. The documents for NWB:N 2 have been adopted from the
final version of format docs released by the original NWB pilot project.
