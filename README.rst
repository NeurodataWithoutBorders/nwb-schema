NWB Schema Format
=================

A format specification schema for the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data format.

To get started using NWB, please go to the `NWB overview website <https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This repo contains:

* The core NWB schema
* The `Documentation for the NWB schema <http://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io>`_ (editable `here <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema/tree/dev/docs/format/source>`_)
* The `HDF5 storage specification <https://nwb-storage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storage_hdf5.html>`_ (editable `here <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema/blob/dev/docs/storage/source/storage_hdf5.rst>`_)

The NWB schema uses the [NWB specification language](http://schema-language.readthedocs.io/),
which defines formal structures for describing the organization of
complex data using basic concepts, e.g., Groups, Datasets, Attributes, and Links.

For more information:

- Learn more about NWB and `nwb.org <http://www.nwb.org/>`_.
- The PyNWB Python API for the NWB format is available on `Github <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb>`_
- The MatNWB Matlab API for the NWB format is available on `Github <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/matnwb>`_

The NWB 1.0 format and API are archived in the [NeurodataWithoutBorders/api-python](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/api-python) repository. https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/api-python/blob/master/nwb/nwb_core.py contains the reference schema for the NWB 1 format.
